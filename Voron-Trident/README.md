## Things to consider
There are a few printed parts recommended for clean cable management. Head over to the STL directory to download these files and print what you'll need before prepping for installation.

It is recommended to get some channel covers for your front corner extrusions to hide the front motor wires on their way to the electronics bay.

## So what's in the box?!
Note that the Contents section of the [assembly manual](assembly_manual.pdf) accounts for individual hardware components. For an improved assembly experience some components are preinstalled.
