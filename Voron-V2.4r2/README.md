# LDO CNC AWD Kit <sub>by Mastur_Mynd and aTinyShellScript</sub>
CNC drive frames designed specifically for your [Voron V2.4](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2)

## Things to consider
There are a few printed parts recommended for clean cable management. Head over to the STL directory to download these files and print what you'll need before prepping for installation.

It is recommended to get some channel covers for your Y extrusions. This will prevent the motor wires from rubbing against the belts.

## So what's in the box?!
Note that the Contents section of the [assembly manual](assembly_manual.pdf) accounts for individual hardware components. For an improved assembly experience some components are preinstalled.
